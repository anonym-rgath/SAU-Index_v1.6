<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The initial request was to convert a single-file static HTML page into a full-stack web application for a Schützenzug (marksmen's platoon) to manage and rank members based on fines. The application should have a database to persist data.

Over the course of development, the requirements evolved significantly:
- **Rebranding:** Change the name from Schützenzug to Rheinzelmänner. Remove Manager from titles. The landing page should say Rheinzelmänner and Verwaltung.
- **UI/UX Changes:**
    - Implement a mobile-first design.
    - Replace bottom navigation with a hamburger menu opening a side drawer.
    - Move the Abmelden (Logout) button exclusively into the navigation drawer.
    - On the ranking/dashboard, remove the ability to add a fine directly from a member's entry.
    - On the statistics page, the Durchschnitt (average) KPI needs a different icon.
    - On the dashboard page, the Lämmchen (second place) KPI needs a wallet icon.
- **Functionality:**
    - Implement user authentication with two roles:  (full access) and  (read-only).
    - Differentiate between  (who can log in) and  (who cannot).
    - Members should have a status of Aktiv or Passiv.
    - Allow an NFC ID to be added and edited for each member.
    - The member list must be sortable by name, status, and creation date.
    - All data aggregation (rankings, statistics) must be based on a fiscal year (August 1st to July 31st), not a calendar year.
    - A new statistics page is required, showing KPIs and charts.
- **Deferred Features:**
    - Data export functionality is not required for now.
    - Real NFC/QR scanning functionality is a demo/placeholder.

**User's preferred language**: German

**what currently exists?**
A complete full-stack application built with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend using a MongoDB database.

The application includes:
- **User Authentication:** JWT-based login with  and  roles.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Admins have full CRUD permissions, while  users have read-only access.
- **Member Management:** Full CRUD for members, including name, NFC ID, and Aktiv/Passiv status. The member list is sortable.
- **Fine Management:** Full CRUD for fines and fine types.
- **Fiscal Year Logic:** All data is displayed and calculated based on the current fiscal year (01.08 - 31.07).
- **Dashboard:** Displays member rankings and key performance indicators (KPIs) for the current fiscal year.
- **Statistics Page:** A dedicated page with charts () and detailed statistics, with a fiscal year selector.
- **Mobile-First UI:** The design is responsive, featuring a top bar and a slide-out drawer for navigation, optimized for mobile devices.

**Last working item**:
- Last item agent was working: The user requested changes to two icons: one on the Statistics page for the average KPI, and another on the Dashboard page for the Lämmchen (second place) KPI, which should be a wallet icon. The agent had just finished implementing the statistics page and fixing a minor bug after a system restart, and has not yet started this new request.

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- Issue 1: Implement Icon Changes (P0)

Issues Detail:
- **Issue 1: Implement Icon Changes**
  - **Description**: The user wants to change two icons to improve visual representation.
    1.  On the Statistics page (), replace the current icon for the Durchschnitt (Average) KPI card.
    2.  On the Dashboard page (), replace the current icon for the Lämmchen (second highest fines) KPI card with a wallet icon.
  - **Attempted fixes:** None. This is a new request.
  - **Next debug checklist:**
    1.  Locate the KPI card components in  and .
    2.  Browse the  library for suitable icons. For the wallet,  is a good choice. For average, icons like , , or  could be used.
    3.  Replace the existing  icon component with the new one in both files.
    4.  Verify the change visually using the screenshot tool.
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: To fulfill a direct user request for UI improvements and enhance the visual language of the application.
  - **Status**: NOT STARTED
  - **Is recurring issue?** N
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
  - **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
- None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **NFC/QR Scan Integration (P1):** Enhance the demo functionality to support actual NFC tag reading or QR code scanning to identify members, likely requiring research into web APIs (Web NFC) or third-party libraries. (File:  has a placeholder).
- **Data Export (P1):** Implement functionality to export ranking or fine data, for example, to a CSV or PDF file. This was explicitly deferred by the user but remains a potential future feature.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Full-Stack Application:** Built the entire application from a static HTML file.
- **User & Role System:** Implemented JWT authentication with 'admin' and 'vorstand' roles (, ).
- **CRUD Operations:** Created complete CRUD functionality for Members, Fines, and Fine Types.
- **Mobile-First Redesign:** Converted the layout to be mobile-first and responsive.
- **Drawer Navigation:** Replaced a fixed bottom navigation with a slide-out drawer menu for a cleaner mobile experience (, ).
- **Fiscal Year Implementation:** Refactored the entire application logic to operate on fiscal years (Aug 1 - Jul 31) instead of calendar years (, ).
- **Statistics Page:** Added a new page with KPIs and  bar charts for data visualization ().
- **Member Sorting:** Implemented multi-criteria sorting on the members list ().
- **Rebranding & UI Polish:** Updated all branding to Rheinzelmänner and applied numerous UI fixes and enhancements based on user feedback.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- None. All identified issues and user requests (except the most recent one) have been addressed.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- No previous fork summary was available. The pod was restarted once due to a memory limit, which required the agent to fix a missing  import in . This was an environmental issue, not a recurring code bug.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS,  for icons,  for charts, Shadcn/UI for components.
- **Backend:** Python with FastAPI.
- **Database:** MongoDB for data persistence.
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for securing API endpoints and managing user sessions.
- **Architecture:** Single Page Application (SPA) with a RESTful API backend.

**key DB schema**
- **users:**  (role is 'admin' or 'vorstand')
- **members:**  (status is 'aktiv' or 'passiv')
- **fines:** 
- **fine_types:** 

**changes in tech stack**
-  and its dependencies () were added to  to support the statistics charts.

**All files of reference**
- : The core of the backend, containing all API endpoints, business logic for fiscal years, and database interactions.
- : The main landing page after login, displays rankings and KPIs.
- : The new statistics page with charts and year selection.
- : Manages the display, sorting, and editing of members.
- : Manages user authentication state and role-based access control for the entire frontend.
- : The main top navigation bar which contains the hamburger menu trigger.
- : The slide-out navigation menu.
- : Contains setup and usage instructions, including credentials.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The application is functional, but some larger components like  and  could be broken down into smaller, more specialized sub-components to improve maintainability.

**key api endpoints**
- : User login.
- : Get current user details and role.
- : Get a list of available fiscal years.
- : Get statistical data for a given fiscal year.
- : GET (all), POST (create).
- : PUT (update), DELETE.
- : GET (all), POST (create).
- : DELETE.
- : GET (all), POST (create).
- : PUT (update), DELETE.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **User Roles are Key:** The app's UI and functionality change drastically based on whether the logged-in user is an  or . The  hook is the source of truth for the user's role on the frontend.
- **Fiscal Year Logic:** All date-based logic revolves around a fiscal year starting August 1st. This is handled in the backend (, ) and consumed by the frontend. Do not assume calendar year calculations.
- **Mobile-First Design:** All UI changes should be tested on a mobile viewport first. The navigation relies on a drawer, not a persistent sidebar or bottom bar.
